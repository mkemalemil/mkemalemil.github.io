Grant Title: An automated country-wide ground deformation monitoring system based on satellite interferometry
Funding Agency: Qatar Ministry of Municipality
Period: 2024-2025

We are continuing our work with the Ministry of Municipality in Qatar to support the Qatar Ground Motion Service (QGMS)â€”a fully automated, satellite-based system that monitors land deformation across the country. This project uses advanced radar data analyses methods (InSAR with Sentinel-1 satellite data) to detect subtle ground movements that may impact infrastructure, such as roads, buildings, or underground utilities.

In earlier phases, we developed and deployed QGMS at Western Michigan University and trained Ministry staff to eventually run the system in-house. Our system tracks ground shifts over time, highlights areas of concern, and provides interactive maps and tools via a dedicated web portal. 

In this new phase (Phase 4), we will:
- Keep the system running for another year on our servers.
- Upgrade the web portal to a newer, more powerful platform.
- Guide the Ministry's technical team as they work to migrate and operate the system on their own infrastructure.

The Qatar Ground Motion Service provides a critical tool for early warning and risk assessment in a rapidly developing country, helping authorities act before small ground movements turn into serious hazards.
