Welcome! 

I'm Mustafa Emil, a researcher focused on understanding the Earth’s changing surface. My work leverages cutting-edge technologies like InSAR time-series analysis and hyperspectral remote sensing to investigate ground deformation and geological processes. I’m passionate about applying these tools to study a range of topics, from geohazards and critical infrastructure monitoring to the impacts of climate change on arid regions and mineral exploration. Thank you for visiting!
