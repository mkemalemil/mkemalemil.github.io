Welcome! 

I am Mustafa Kemal Emil, a geoscientist specializing in remote sensing, geospatial data science, and Earth surface processes. My research integrates advanced techniques such as InSAR time-series analysis, hyperspectral imaging, and machine learning to monitor ground deformation, assess geohazards, and explore surface mineralogy. I am particularly interested in the application of satellite Earth observation and geospatial analytics to understand environmental changes, infrastructure stability, and natural hazards in arid and semi-arid regions. My work aims to bridge the gap between cutting-edge geospatial technologies and real-world challenges in geology, hydrology, and hazard mitigation.
