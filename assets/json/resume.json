Excess water from the 1st event (25.5 × 109 m3) was channeled to depressions within the plateau west of the Nile Valley, forming the Tushka Lakes, where it was left to evaporate, a fate that awaits the 53.5 × 109 m3 from the 2nd event while the underlying fossil Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System is being depleted (−0.98 × 109 m3/yr). We simulated release scenarios of excess Lake Nasser waters (53.5 × 109 m3) to proximal lowlands; preference was given to the scenario that recharged the aquifer through infiltration (74.3%) and minimized losses to evaporation (20.1%) and surface runoff (5.6%). Findings serve as an example of adaptations that replace catastrophic consequences of climate change with beneficial and sustainable development opportunities."},{"name":"Über einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt","publisher":"Annalen der Physik","releaseDate":"1905-03-18","url":"https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Über_einen_die_Erzeugung_und_Verwandlung_des_Lichtes_betreffenden_heuristischen_Gesichtspunkt","summary":"In the second paper, he applied the quantum theory to light to explain the photoelectric effect.
